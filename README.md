# Unmanned-Aquatic-Mutifunctional-Robot

This repository represents the design of a remote -controlled floating waste collecting robot which can be used in stagnant water bodies. Direct disposal of solid waste, non-treated industrial waste oil spills are major causes of water pollution. Cleaning the waste can cause diseases and it plays a challenging issue for municipality workers. The issue is addressed by proposing a solution using the Internet of Things (IoT) which is an evolving technology. Multi-purpose aquatic robot is an IoT based system which helps us in multiple ways. It helps in collecting all the surface waste from the water and oil spills economically and effectively. The system has several sensors like turbidity, pH and temperature sensor which will help to check the quality of water. The data from the sensor will be sent on the cloud. The system also has a fish feeder system, a weed cutting system and a skimmer belt to collect the oil spills from the water bodies.
